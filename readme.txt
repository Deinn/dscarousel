* DsCarousel is a simple jQuery Carousel Plugin, it is in his first version, so, bugs can occur. In this case, mail-me: l.deinn@gmail.com

* This plugin make use of jQuery v1.8.3, that included in the /js/libs diretory

* The required files for this plugin run correctly is:
   - The source (jquery.dscarousel.js)
   - The stylesheet (dscarousel.css) - this styles can be edited, since you know what you're doing

* If you wish use the navigation arrows, the files "left.png" and "right.png" will be useful

* There is a sample file (sample.html) that shows a basic form to use this plugin, in this file, it's possible to see the basic structure of usage

* Feel free to make any edit on the source, but i'll thank you if you contact me and suggest a improvement on the code
